# DCS Calibration Test Plan

## Test discipline

Change one variable at a time. Record DCS version, F-14 variant, map, runway, gross weight, fuel, stores/drag index, weather, flap configuration, RPM, and control technique.

Use the same control technique across repeated runs. Perform at least three runs for any point that will become a calibration anchor.

## Priority 1: true V1 / engine-failure field performance

For each configuration:

- UP
- MANEUVER
- FULL

At 65,000 lb, SL/15 C/calm/dry/MIL:

1. Choose candidate engine-failure speeds from approximately 0.85 Vr to Vr-3 in 5 kt increments.
2. At the test speed, fail one engine consistently using the same method.
3. Reject tests: record distance to full stop.
4. Continue tests: record distance to liftoff and to 50 ft AGL if practical.
5. Repeat each point three times.
6. Refine around the ASD/AGD crossover in 1 kt increments.

Repeat the final crossover test at 58,000 and 72,000 lb.

This dataset will replace the current estimated balanced-field V1 sensitivity.

## Priority 2: maneuver flaps

At weights:

- 58,000
- 65,000
- 72,000 lb

At pressure altitudes:

- 0
- 4,000
- 8,000 ft

At temperatures:

- approximately -7
- 15
- 32
- 49 C

Record:

- Vr
- liftoff distance
- 50-ft distance if practical
- reject distance at the selected V1
- initial climb gradient

This mirrors the structure of the existing UP/FULL table.

## Priority 3: reduced RPM

At 65,000 lb, SL/15 C:

UP:
- 85 through 100% in 2% increments

MANEUVER:
- 90 through 100% in 2% increments

FULL:
- 98 and 100%

Record:

- actual stabilized RPM
- fuel flow per engine
- Vr
- distance
- initial climb gradient

This will replace the current nonlinear reduced-thrust assumption.

## Priority 4: Vfs and stabilator trim target

At 55,000, 65,000, and 75,000 lb, test each takeoff flap configuration on a standard-day, calm-wind departure:

1. Set pitch trim 000 before takeoff.
2. Record the generated V2, Vfs, and midpoint trim-target speed.
3. After liftoff, complete the intended gear and flap transition.
4. Stabilize at the displayed midpoint speed and trim to remove steady pitch force.
5. Record pitch-trim command position or export value, stabilator position if available, configuration, and actual stabilized IAS.
6. Repeat each condition three times.

The midpoint speed may remain an advisory estimate while testing is incomplete. Do not publish a numerical stabilator-angle schedule until the measured relationship is repeatable across weight and flap configurations.

## Priority 5: climb

At 60,000 and 70,000 lb:

- altitudes every 5,000 ft through 30,000 ft
- 200 / 225 / 250 / 300 KIAS where applicable
- MIL and selected reduced RPMs

Record steady:

- TAS/Mach
- fuel flow
- vertical speed
- aircraft configuration

For each weight, fly the generated Most Efficient and Minimum Time (MIL) schedules from brake release or 1,000 ft through 10,000 ft. Record elapsed time, fuel at profile start, and fuel at 10,000 ft. Compare the measured time/fuel tradeoff with the profile summary before changing either optimizer.

## Priority 6: cruise

At 50/60/70k gross weight and representative drag indices:

- fly the table optimum altitude and M0.718
- stabilize for at least one minute
- record fuel flow and required throttle/RPM
- repeat one altitude above and below optimum

This validates whether the legacy optimum table is consistent with current DCS and calibrates the fuel model.

## Priority 7: landing

At 45/50/55k landing weight:

- full flaps
- SL/15 C calm
- dry runway

Record:

- stabilized on-speed IAS at 15 units AOA
- threshold speed
- touchdown speed
- ground roll with consistent braking technique

Then test headwind and wet-surface effects separately.
